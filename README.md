# Comparison-of-ML-models-for-predicting-AQI

<b>Goal:</b> In this project we are comparing various machine learning models to find which model works better for predicting the AQI (Air Quality Index).

### Machine learning models used ###
In this project we are using regression models such as:
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
* Random Forest Regression
* Support Vector regression (SVR)
